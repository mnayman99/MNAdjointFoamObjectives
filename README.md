# MNAdjointFoamObjectives
Modification and updating of OpenFOAM v2112 adjoint objective functions for the requirements of an M.A.Sc in Aeronautical Engineering.

All code needed to compile the objective library is included in this repository. It is assumed that you have OpenFOAM v2112 installed, as the Make/options file depends on the information found in the source code of OpenFOAM.
